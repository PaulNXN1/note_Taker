# Note Taker Starter Code

## Description  ðŸ’»
UPenn Module #10 Assignment.
This assignment tasked the student to create / add to code to an application that ultimately was a note taker web application.  The assignment, called **Note Taker,** was given to understand the *back-end* aspects of web development, using Express.js and GET/POST requests.  While running, the user will be able to type specific text and **save** it to the web application.  The POST requests, saved within an object, will be assigned a unique id, which can ultimately be using for a DELETE request.  

Node.js is used to originally run the project.  Port assignment is '4444'. 

Express.js is used second.  

## Code Contributors
